Here's a design that I want to code using Vite, React, typescript and css modules. Note that this is a mobile view design. 
Assume I have all the images of the profiles somewhere in the images directory.
Also assume I've downloaded the fonts locally in assets/fonts folder.

The style guideline is as the following:

## Colors

### Primary

Moderate violet: hsl(263, 55%, 52%)
Very dark grayish blue: hsl(217, 19%, 35%)
Very dark blackish blue: hsl(219, 29%, 14%)
White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)

### Neutral

Light gray: hsl(0, 0%, 81%)
Light grayish blue: hsl(210, 46%, 95%)

Note for text colors:

1. "Verified Graduate" has the same color as the person's name with 50% opacity
2. Review paragraphs inside the quotations have the same color as well, but are at 70% opacity

## Typography

### Body Copy

- Font size: 13px

### Font

- Family: [Barlow Semi Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Semi+Condensed)
- Weights: 500, 600

Now help me code this design step by step. Please use best practices (theming, css variables, reuse components, etc.)
